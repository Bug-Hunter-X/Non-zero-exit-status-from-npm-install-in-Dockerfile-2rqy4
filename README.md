# Dockerfile Bug: Non-zero exit status from npm install

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using npm install within a Dockerfile. The issue arises from a failure during the installation of project dependencies, resulting in a non-zero exit status and preventing the image from building correctly.

## Bug Description:

The provided Dockerfile attempts to build a Node.js application.  However, due to an error (which may be related to incorrect package.json configurations, network issues, or permission problems), the `npm install` command fails.  The Docker build process stops at this point, reporting a non-zero exit status.

## Solution:

The solution involves carefully reviewing the `package.json` file for any errors and adding better error handling in the Dockerfile, such as running npm install with --verbose flag to get more detailed error messages and potentially specifying a different node version.  The `Dockerfile.fixed` provides the corrected approach.
